Wow! I love blogging so much already.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

<Panel type="info" title="MDX Features">
  MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.
</Panel>

## Using React Components in MDX

One of the great features of MDX is the ability to use React components directly in your markdown. This allows for much more interactive and dynamic content.

```jsx
// Example of a React component in MDX
import { Chart } from '../components/Chart';

# Here's a chart
<Chart data={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]} />
```

## Code Highlighting

MDX also supports code highlighting out of the box:

```javascript
// This is some JavaScript code
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```css
/* This is some CSS */
body {
  font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
```

## Gatsby and MDX Together

Gatsby and MDX make a powerful combination for building content-rich websites. Gatsby provides the framework and optimization, while MDX allows for rich, interactive content.

  Gatsby automatically optimizes your site for performance, including code splitting, image optimization, and prefetching resources.
