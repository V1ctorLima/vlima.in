# Hello World

This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

## What I've learned

Gatsby is a powerful framework for building static websites. It uses React and GraphQL to create fast, optimized sites.

Here are some of its benefits:

- Fast performance
- Great developer experience
- Strong ecosystem

## Code Example

```js
// A simple JavaScript example
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Next Steps

I plan to write more about:

1. Web development
2. React
3. Gatsby

Stay tuned for more updates!
